# For each planning group defined by its name, execute the given trajectory with that group.
# One or more groups can be set.

# Execute the Cartesian trajectories for multiple planning groups.

# Requests
# group_names: The planning groups.
# goal_type [opt]: BASE_ABS (0): The trajectory pose is wrt the reference frame. By default goal_type=0.
#                  BASE_REL (1): The pose is wrt the reference frame transferred to current ee frame's origin.
#                  EEF (2): The pose is wrt the end-effector frame.
# trajectories: One for each group.
